# Cross Sell prediction

Project to predict if a customer from an insurance company that has provided Health Insurance will need vehicle insurance, using the data presented on the following Kaggle dataset: [Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction). Here various under and oversampling techniques were analysed based on how they improved the performance of an XGBoost and other classification models.

## Roadmap

- [x] Test dependency between variables and response

- [x] Measure the correlation between variables

- [x] Test change of classification threshold on prediction results

- [ ] Test sampling techniques to deal with imbalanced classes

- [ ] Deploy model locally
